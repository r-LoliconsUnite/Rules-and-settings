    * 1.1) Self posts discussing lolicon and loli hentai are allowed to a degree, **but do not ask for loli hentai**
    * 1.2) Comments excessively sexualizing images or otherwise being perverty will be removed. Case by case basis, mods have final decision
    * The only exception is if your post comes from a NSFW source, such as a NSFW artist, or an album of pictures.
