## Meta FAQ

### Q: Why are the mods so anti loli lewds/puritans?

A: We're not. We like them. We didn't ban loli lewds because we don't like it, rather because it is against reddit's content policy itself, and the admins don't like it. The admins are king, so we have base our decisions on their standards. [\[Origin\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/loliconsunite/comments/a1ath3/is_it_just_me_who_think_this_sub_has_become_bland/eaoebmd/)

The purpose of this subreddit is to be a friendly place for lolicons on reddit. If admins say no lewdness at all, then so be it. We can't help it. We'll still keep on existing. Some lolis on reddit are better than no lolis on reddit. There's no value or utilty gained in being a martyr by getting banned. It's true that it will greatly diminish the lolicon community as lewdness is an important part of lolis, and lots will jump into another sub or even to another platform. But for now, we fully intend to survive. [\[Origin\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/loliconsunite/comments/9w17uo/discussion_about_rule_1/e9gzjv5/) 

The only lolicon sub that can exist on Reddit are those who follow reddit's rules. And we've decided that we'll be that subreddit [\[Origin\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/loliconsunite/comments/9l47f2/is_it_okay_to_lewd_lolis_in_that_reddit_trollface/e74cr4h/)

### Q: Why do you have to help reddit admins enforce their content policy? Just ignore them!

A: If the admins think we're not doing our job to enforce the content policy properly, then we are responsible and we will face consequences. We meaning mods and subreddit. [\[Origin\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/loliconsunite/comments/9uuysd/modpost_permanent_exclusion_rule_1/e9eh9kq/)

### Q: But there are lewder subreddits around, and they haven't been banned yet!

A: We know that. r/hentinycasual was banned only recently. As for why it took the admins so long, we have no idea. There are often lewder content in other subs such as r/Megumin. What we have a very clear idea of though, is that at the end explicit lolicon is against Reddit’s contest policy. And we’re going to abide by that. We’re going to follow the admins and we’re not going to get banned. [\[Origin\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/loliconsunite/comments/9wv8xb/reddit_hypocrisy/e9nmgyd/)

### Q: We've been excluded from r/all. Isn't it fine to experimentate  with loosening rules?

A: We believe we have everything to lose. Everything we’ve done in the past year, everyone’s posts and discussions. Testing the waters must be approached using this mindset. [\[Origin\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/loliconsunite/comments/9w17uo/discussion_about_rule_1/e9gzjv5/)

### Q: What is your goal?

A: Despite the name being loliconsunite, we welcome everyone, lolicon or not. The only conditions is to be civil (and of course, the other rules)

### Q: Why did you make a subreddit on a site that hates you?

A: We do it not because it is easy, but because it is hard. Sure we can all off to /b/, but there's no sense of achievement there. [\[Origin\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/loliconsunite/comments/a4beei/lets_play_this_board_game_oniichan/ebekg8h/) 

### Q: What's the difference between this sub and r/CleanLoli?

A: We encourage discussion/text posts, unlike  r/CleanLoli where they removed the button for discussion posts. Though, most users likes to post pics not text posts. We can't change that. We're just saying discussion posts are perfectly fine as well. [\[Origin\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/loliconsunite/comments/a1ath3/is_it_just_me_who_think_this_sub_has_become_bland/eaug658/)

### Q: Why are you so against the lolice?

A: It's fine to spin the anti-lolicon arguments into a joke, but some has gone too far. The lolicons participating in the lolice meme is helping the people who take it seriously, then justifying it by saying it's a joke.

After all their talk, some do actually try to take action: planning a raid on our discord server or this subreddit (we stopped it in time fortunately), discussing to put in an undercover mod. That's nothing but brigading another subreddit -- a direct violation of the content policy. I doubt the admins will take "but it was a joke!" as a valid excuse to plan a brigade. Even the mods openly claimed that this sub is their enemy. This hostility -- even as a joke -- is not something we want to allow in the sub. We welcome lolicons and non lolicons on the condition to be civil, and the hostility the lolice has shown towards us is the exact opposite of that.

Just to be clear, we won't ban you for lolice memes except if you're repeatedly breaking it. It's fine if you participate there. All we ask of you is not to do it in this subreddit. Do it anywhere else but here  [\[Origin\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/loliconsunite/comments/9tskkz/how_would_you_describe_this_creature/e90kb46/)

### Q: My post was caught by a spam filter?

A: Reddit has multiple layers of the spam filter. The first few are visible to admins only, and they apparently filter out like 80% of the spam. Then, they pass through the final spam filter that we can see. So while we can approve posts caught by the mod spam filter, we have no idea what the admins did in their spam filters

### Q: Have you considered using an alternative to discord? Like reddit chat?

A: I don't use new reddit and its features on principle because it's a bad direction for reddit to go. If we're going to have another chat though, it will likely be IRC. No downloads, no register, no sign in, no need to use reddit's shitty version of everything. [\[Origin\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/loliconsunite/comments/9mjohz/rloliconsunite_chat/e7f4d85/)
